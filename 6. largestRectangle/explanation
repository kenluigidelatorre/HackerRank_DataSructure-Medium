This program finds the largest rectangular area that can fit inside a histogram. It uses a stack to track the barsâ€™ indices. When a bar is 
shorter than the one before it, the program calculates the area using the height of the taller bar and determines how wide that rectangle 
can extend. It keeps updating the maximum area found. Finally, it repeats this for all remaining bars in the stack, ensuring the largest 
possible rectangle is returned.
