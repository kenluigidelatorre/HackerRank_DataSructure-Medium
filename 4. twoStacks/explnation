This program finds the maximum number of elements you can remove from two stacks without the total sum going over a given limit.
It first takes as many numbers as possible from the first stack, then starts adding numbers from the second stack.
If the total becomes too large, it removes numbers from the first stack until the sum is small enough again.
The goal is to find the biggest count of numbers that can be taken while keeping the sum within the limit.
