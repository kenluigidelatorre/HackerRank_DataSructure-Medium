This program finds the smallest and largest groups of connected nodes in a graph. Each pair of numbers represents a link between two nodes. 
Using a union-find system, the program connects related nodes into groups, counts how many nodes each group has, and finally prints the 
smallest and largest group sizes that contain more than one node.
