This program checks if a string of brackets is properly balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets. 
Every time a closing bracket appears, the program checks if it matches the most recent opening one. If everything 
matches correctly and no brackets are left open, it prints "YES", otherwise "NO".
