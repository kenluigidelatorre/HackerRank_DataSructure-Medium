This program finds the shortest path a player can take on a grid with open cells (.) and walls (X). From the starting position, 
the player can move in straight lines up, down, left, or right until hitting a wall or the edge. The program uses a breadth-first 
search (BFS) to explore all possible moves step by step and records how many moves it takes to reach each cell. The fewest number 
of moves to reach the goal position is then printed as the result.
