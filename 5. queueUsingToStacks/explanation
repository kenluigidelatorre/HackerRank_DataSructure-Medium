This program builds a queue using two stacks. One stack stores new elements added to the queue, while the other stack 
holds elements ready to be removed or viewed. When the second stack is empty and we need to remove or look at the front 
element, the program transfers all items from the first stack to the second, reversing their order. This makes sure that 
the element added first is always the one removed first, just like in a normal queue.
