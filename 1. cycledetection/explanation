This program checks if a linked list has a cycle (meaning the nodes loop back to an earlier node instead of ending). 
It uses two pointers: one moves one step at a time (slow), and the other moves two steps (fast). If there’s a loop, 
they will eventually meet inside the cycle. If the fast pointer reaches the end (null), then there’s no cycle. This 
approach is efficient because it doesn’t need extra memory, just careful movement of pointers.
